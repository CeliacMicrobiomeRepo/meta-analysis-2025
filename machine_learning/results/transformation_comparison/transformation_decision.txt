We tested 16 transformations on 2 analysis groups (Duodenal Active and Stool Treated) and 2 evaluation techniques (K-fold and LODO). The 16 transformations consistented of CLR, TSS, Log10 divided by sum of Log10's and Log10 centered on median of Log10's. Each of these were trialed with filtering before and filtering afterwards, as well as with and without a final Z-score applied. 

Different transformations showed varied performance depending on the analysis group and the evaluation technique. We selected TSS with filtering afterwards, due to it having the highest mean AUC of all 16 transformations across all both analysis groups and both evaluation techniques, with the aim of selecting the overall best transformation. It also has the perk of being highly interpretable.
